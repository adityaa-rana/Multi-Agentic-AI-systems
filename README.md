# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Multi-Agentic AI Systems with CrewAI & OpenAI LLM  

This repository contains two **multi-agent AI systems** built using [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI) and **OpenAI LLMs**.  
Both systems demonstrate **inter-agent collaboration**, asynchronous task execution, and practical use cases of multi-agent orchestration.  

---

## 📌 Projects Included
### 1️⃣ Event Planner Crew  
An AI-powered system where multiple agents collaborate to **plan and manage events**.  
- Agents handle **venue coordination, logistics, and marketing**.  
- Demonstrates **parallel execution** and **decision-making**.  

### 2️⃣ Resume Tailoring Crew  
A system where agents collaborate to **tailor resumes** based on job descriptions.  
- Agents analyze job postings.  
- Suggest improvements to resumes.  
- Output is a **job-specific resume draft**.
